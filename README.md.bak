# Classification models for event-related potentials of electroencephalogram

This project makes a comprehensive comparison of several classification models. The classification object is an event. The event consists of brain activity measurements. The user receives a visual or audio stimulus. After the onset of the trigger, the EEG electrodes measure the event-related potentials. So, each event produces a two-way matrix. Its rows correspond to the electrodes, and columns correspond to time samples. The dataset is a pair design and target vector. The design matrix is three-way (event, electrode, time). Elements of the target are classes of events.

The precognitive classification means that the most informative part of the signal is expected to be in the earliest stages of the event-related potential.
